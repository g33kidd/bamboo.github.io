Pipes are what is used to provide functionality to Endpoints and control the flow of a request. However, you're not just limited to one. A single [action](/concepts/actions) can have several pipes connected to it, and a pipe can also have several pipes connected to it.

## Example

Here is an example of a setup of pipes that handles Bearer Token Authorization:

```ts
// For this example we'll assume that our header is 'Authorization: 1234xxxx'
export default new Pipe(
  "authentication",
  async (endpoint: Endpoint) => {
    const bearerToken = endpoint.header("authorization");

    if (bearerToken) {
      endpoint.stash("bearer-token", bearerToken);
    } else {
      endpoint.stash("bearer-token", 0);
    }

    return endpoint;
  },
  []
);
```

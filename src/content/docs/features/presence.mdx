:::caution[WIP]
Presence is currently a work-in-progress. It will be made simpler to use, more robust, and provide more features in the future.

The API for Presence is currently unstable and will be changing.

Bamboo provides a Presence module for maintaining global state and individual entity state. Let's take a look at a basic example of using Presence. With this example we won't worry about individual state, but we will manage the global state of our application.

In this example, we'll manage a count of how many active users there are. Assuming that we're handling realtime functionality elsewhere, we'll just focus on using presence here.

```ts
type GlobalState = { count: { users: number } };

const initialState: GlobalState = { count: { users: 0 } };
const presence = new Presence<GlobalState, any>("chat", initialState, {
  open(state, _) {
    presence.setState({ ...state, count: { users: state.count.users + 1 } });
  },
  close(state, _) {
    if (state.count.users > 0) {
      presence.setState({ ...state, count: { users: state.count.users - 1 } });
    }
  },
  onUpdate(prev, current) {
    // do something with the current state and previous state
  },
});

// From websockets or wherever entities are coming from:
//...
join(id) {
  presence.open({key: id, state: { online: true }})
},
leave(id) {
  presence.close({ key: id, state: { online: false } })
}
// ...
```

This can be used in-conjunction with [Telegram](/features/telegram) to sync state between multiple machines:

```ts
// ...
  onUpdate(prev, current) {
    client.publish({
      topic: 'chat',
      state: {
        prev, current
      }
    })
  }
// ...
// which can then be handled by the Telegram client listener
// ...
  handle(payload) {
    if (payload.topic === 'chat') {
      presence.setState(payload.state.current)
    }
  }
```

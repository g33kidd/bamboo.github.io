description: How to send messages to other services using Telegram
---

Not to be confused with the messaging app Telegram! Bamboo's Telegram is for sending messages between different machines, services, or whatever you may find it useful for.

Originally this was created to work smoothly with a site hosted on [Fly.io](https://fly.io). As fly allows you to run your application on several machines, some applications may need to transfer or sync state between each other. Telegram was created for this purpose!

:::caution[One-way Messages]
Currently, Telegram only supports sending one-way messages. This will be changed in the future to allow sending messages back and forth.

## Server

`TelegramServer` is responsible for receiving messages from clients connected to it, and broadcasting those messages to all other clients.

In order to use Telegram, you first need to create a server. A Telegram Server can be created simply by creating a new instance of a `TelegramServer`:

```ts
// index.ts
import { TelegramServer } from "bamboo";
new TelegramServer({ hostname: "localhost", port: 4567 });
```

##### High-Availability

If needed, you can in theory, use a TelegramServer to manage several other instance of TelegramServers. This would require the use of a TelegramClient to send message. An example of this is below:

```ts
// TODO: Write an example that uses a single TelegramServer to send messages to several TelegramServers.
```

## Client

A client is responsible for broadcasting messages and receiving messages. Here is a basic example of a client:

```ts
import { TelegramClient } from "bamboo";

const client = new TelegramClient({
  hostname: "localhost",
  port: 4567,
  handler(payload) {
    console.log(payload);
  },
});

client.broadcast({
  topic: "rooms:1",
  message: "A message from Alice!",
  datetime: Date.now(),
});
```

If you're looking for a more complex example of Telegram in-action, here's an example that shows several clients communicating with eachother:

```ts
const clients = [];

for (let i = 0; i < 120; i++) {
  const client = new TelegramClient({
    hostname: "0.0.0.0",
    port: 4567,
    handler(payload) {
      console.log(payload);
    },
  });

  setInterval(() => {
    const bytes = randomBytes(32).toString("base64");
    client.broadcast({
      topic: "room:1",
      message: bytes,
      datetime: new Date(Date.now()).toTimeString(),
    });
  }, 10 * i);

  clients.push(client);
}
```
